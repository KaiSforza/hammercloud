   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to hammercloud's documentation!
=======================================

Hammercloud is a utility for working with Rackspace servers and accounts
from the command line.

What does it do
---------------

Currently still expanding that.  This is just getting stuff added as I think
about it

Currently it can:

- Log you into nextgen cloud servers (using the uuid or server name)
- Log you into the hypervisor for a cloud server (assuming you have
  access, also based on uuid or server name)
- Show general information about the cloud server
